# HackaCamel

OCaml hacking ideas, small and large. All the useful information is on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/tarides/projects/32/views/1). This project board contains hacking ideas of various sizes and skill levels.  

## Adding ideas

Add a new item. Make sure to fill in the fields associated with estimated effort. It is not meant to be perfect. Ok to over or underestimate. Convert the item to an issue on this (https://github.com/tarides/HackaCamel) repo. Add enough details so that some one can get started with just the details in the issue thread.

## Starting to work on an idea listed in the board

If you are keen to hack on an idea
* if you have write access to the repo, assign the corresponding issue to yourself and start hacking.
* otherwise, say so in the issue thread and start hacking. Someone will eventually get to this.

Update the status to "In Progress".
